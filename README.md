Final Project Name: What's So Funny About a Skull and a Statue? A Semantic Analysis of Sentence-Final Emojis.

Project Overview: In this project, we will be observing certain emojis that appear to be semantically unrelated, but occur in similar contexts on the internet. We will be looking at three emojis: crying (ðŸ˜­), moai (ðŸ—¿) and skull (ðŸ’€), at its sentence-final position and observing their accepted semantic interpretations compared to their likely intended meaning. Language context, emoji repetition, and humor are some aspects that will be focused on to observe the interpretations of the ambiguous emojis.
